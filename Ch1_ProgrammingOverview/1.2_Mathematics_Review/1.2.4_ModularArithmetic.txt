We say that A is congruent to B modulo N, written A ≡ B (mod N), 
if N divides A − B. Intuitively, this means that the remainder 
is the same when either A or B is divided by N. Thus, 81 ≡ 61 ≡ 1 (mod 10). 
As with equality, if A ≡ B (mod N), then A + C ≡ B + C (mod N) and AD ≡ BD (mod N).


First, if N is prime, then ab ≡ 0 (mod N) is true if and only if a ≡ 0 (mod N)
or b ≡ 0 (mod N). In other words, if a prime number N divides a product of two
numbers, it divides at least one of the two numbers.
Second, if N is prime, then the equation ax ≡ 1 (mod N) has a unique solution
(mod N) for all 0 < a < N. This solution, 0 < x < N, is the multiplicative inverse.
Third, if N is prime, then the equation x2 ≡ a (mod N) has either two solutions
(mod N) for all 0 < a < N, or it has no solutions.
There are many theorems that apply to modular arithmetic, and some of them require
extraordinary proofs in number theory. We will use modular arithmetic sparingly, and the
preceding theorems will suffice.
